        Oh, hi!
        <br>
        What are you doing all the way out here?
        <br>
        Are you lost?
        <br>
        Ahh, I see.
        <br>
        You were looking at stuff and couldn't find yourself.
        <br>
        Don't worry, I can help you get back to where you need to go.
